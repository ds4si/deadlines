## AI/ML/DS Deadlines 4 Africa 

Countdowns to AI/ML/DS conference deadlines for Africans

## Adding/updating a conference

To keep things minimal, I'm only looking to list top-tier conferences in AI as per [conferenceranks.com][6]. Feel free to maintain a separate fork if you don't see your sub-field or conference of interest listed.

To add or update information:
- Fork the repository
- Update `_data/conferences.yml`
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `place`, `sub` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Send a pull request
